            <b>Within reach</b> is a project in which I explored something we touch every day. <br>
            I chose my phone but with a little more than that. I combined the phone, and mobile apps I use with things I do in my daily routine. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cover, the lock screen of a phone, with a character inviting you to come inside, swipe up, look through my day. The first thing, the home screen to have a glance at what is coming next.  Now, let's start the day, waking up with the clock app. Next, a faucet combined with the Facebook app, representing each morning brushing my teeth. Following this, I combined Instagram with a closet to represent getting dressed, a coffee mug with the WhatsApp logo, a laptop with Outlook for the daily coffee, and an email check.  Subsequently, a key morphed into the TikTok logo, as well as the bus into the maps app for the everyday commute. Finally, the back of the phone closes a part of the journey.
