                    Spot Me is an app prototype I created in collaboration with a team. Spot Me is an innovative app that helps to reunite lost animals with their owners and helps stray animals have a better quality of life. Essentially, we created an easy way to find lost animals and help those who don’t have where to live, reducing their time on the streets.

                    I designed the front-end user interface using proto.io. I wanted to make and engaging, user-friendly interface; for this I used different images, illustrations and arrangements. I also developed graphics and layouts, including the app’s logo using Adobe Illustrator.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>·</b> The Spot Me app allows you to report the location of stray animals and create a profile for the lost pet receiving automatic notifications every time a reported animal matches the characteristics of your pet. <br><br>
                <b>·</b> The app has the potential to contribute to local businesses, animal rights groups, and shelters. In addition, it can help find countless animals a proper home as well as reunite them with their owner, all from the convenience of your phone.<br><br>
                <b>·</b> You can also gain Paw Power, the special in-app currency used to donate to various groups we collaborate with. Spot Me will use its service to provide a platform for users to donate to and receive more information on Animal Rights Organizations.
